## Overview

This repository contains a static frontend implementation (clone) of the **Venue (Template 522)** website by TemplateMo.

* **Pure CSS3 Styling**
  Responsive layout designed using Flexbox and Media Queries, without external frameworks.

* **CSS Custom Properties**
  Centralized variable management (`:root`) for consistent theming and maintainable styling.
